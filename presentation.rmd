## Purpose

-   Creating beautiful, professional documents and presentations with ease

## Why Should You Use Rmarkdown?

-   Simplifies workflow by combining computation and writing
-   Very simple syntax as it uses the markdown language
-   Can evaluate code chunks in many languages
-   Out of the box support for many languages through Knitr.
    -   Python, Shell, SQL, Rcpp, Stan, Julia, C, Fortran, Javascript and CSS
-   Provides inbuilt support for LaTeX typesetting
    -   Easily confused

## Output Formats

-   PDF Documents
-   Github Pages
-   Latex
-   Context
-   Presentations
    -   Multiple backends for different flavors
-   Word Documents

## Required Packages

-   RMarkdown imports
    -   knitr, methods, tinytex, tools, utils, xfun, yaml

    -   bslib, evaluate, fontawesome, htmltools jquerylib, jsonlite
-   Rmarkdown also requires an installation of Pandoc, a document converter
    -   Pandoc comes preinstalled with R Studio

# Example 1

## Creating and Placing a Graph

-   Create preamble
-   Create a section heading using "\#"
-   Encase code of supported language using "`{lang}`"
-   So, to make a simple heading we do

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```

## Headings and Code Block

-   We can create headings create a heading and code block

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Plot of random y data
 ```{r}
 x <- 0:99
 y <- rnorm(100)
 plot(x,y)
\```
```

## Generated Output

```{r example1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Outputted pdf from code",fig.align = "center",  out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("example1.png")
```

# Example 2

## This presentation

-   [Presentation Source Code](https://github.com/alucascu/PackagePresentationDATA/blob/main/presentation.rmd)

# Example 3

## Calculating energy states of a Muonium atom in a magnetic field

-   [Energy Level Website](example3.html)
-   Notice that Rmarkdown generates the graph from python code. However, the command 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
  {r, eval = FALSE}
```

-   in the code block declaration prevents the code from being shown.

## Alternatives

-   Quarto
    -   Markdown language that can render Python, Julia, R, and Observable
    -   Pros:
        -   VS Code Extension
        -   "Successor to R Markdown"
        -   Many of the separate packages you use in R markdown are bundled
    -   Cons
        -   Separate software, not a package
        -   Clunky latex integration
        -   Relatively small language support
